# Welcome to the Medical Data Universe (MDU) repository! 

MDU is an open-access repository to support sharing of COVID-19 data. If you are interested in using real-world data for research or in contributing data for the betterment of society, then you are at the right place. 

## Background ##

Ever since the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been numerous calls **to accelerate and improve data sharing**. Nonprofit organizations, universities, and other institutions worldwide are turning to **artificial intelligence (AI) to better understand the disease and its impact on human health**. However, AI models require **a lot of data** both during training to compute accurate predictions and during testing to **ensure generalizability** across unseen cohorts. Although data sharing is seen now, more than ever, as an ethical and moral obligation in research, there are many **obstacles that hinder** the process, including the limited availability of data, poor data quality, concerns over data governance, concerns over ethical use of data, bureaucratic barriers, and an overarching **lack of commonality**.

There exists many notable initiatives that aim to improve sharing of medical data at local, national, and international levels. We compiled a list [here for reference](files/list-of-data-platforms.csv). We summarize the process to share/access data and incentives to share data. Yet, this hyper-fragmentation of efforts is challenging. A **collaborative and open approach** is much needed to allow researchers to access and use data and software to tackle challenges related to healthcare, especially in the context of COVID-19.

## Project summary ##

MDU is an open repository of de-identified clinical data related to COVID-19, which may include, but is not limited to, patient data and clinical trials data. Through this repository, we hope to facilitate data access and accelerate AI research on COVID-19 diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Data is available for use for research purposes only. For commercial uses, please email us at <datasharing.ignite@gmail.com>.

## Terms and conditions ##

The Medical Data Universe (MDU) is intending to establish a relationship between individuals and the MDU github repository for the purposes of managing the data sharing on the individual’s behalf. It provides complete control over the collected copy of the participant’s data to others. 
* By sharing data through this platform on git, any data pulled and pushed from the repository is accessible based github processes and you are agreeing to host your dataset here.
* This does not authorize the MDU github repository to function as a healthcare provider. 
* The participant’s copy of medical data does not replace existing provider-maintained records that law and regulation require healthcare providers to maintain, nor does it have any impact on provider responsibility to report public health data or perform any other functions related to medical records as may be required by law. 
* The individual and MDU, authorizes MDU, on participant’s behalf, to acquire, receive, collective, maintain, share, and delete the medical data as granted pursuant to this Agreement once the data shared through the MDU github repository.
* Participant must cite the original source of the shared data. 
* MDU shall not use or further disclose Participant’s data, either in whole or in part, other than as permitted by this Agreement.
