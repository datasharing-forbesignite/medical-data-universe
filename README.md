# Welcome to the Medical Data Universe (MDU) repository! 

MDU is an open-access repository to support sharing of COVID-19 data.

## Background ##

Ever since the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been numerous calls to accelerate and improve data sharing. Nonprofit organizations, universities, and other institutions worldwide are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to better understand the disease and its impact on human health. However, AI models require a lot of data both during training to compute accurate predictions and during testing to ensure generalizability across unseen cohorts. Although data sharing is seen now, more than ever, as an ethical and moral obligation in research, there are many obstacles that may hinder the process: limited availability of data, poor data quality, concerns over data governance, and concerns over ethical use of data (including accountability and liability for data applications) are among the main ones (TODO: make a figure).

There exists many initiatives that aim to improve data sharing for COVID-19 at local, national, and international levels. Yet, this hyper-fragmentation of efforts is challenging. A collaborative and open approach is much needed to allow researchers to access and use data and software to tackle challenges related to the disease.

## Project Summary: ##
This is an effort to compile an open repository of de-identified clinical and demographical data of COVID patients. By building this repository, we hope to facilitate data access and accelerate AI-powered research on COVID-19 signs, symptoms, stages, and care plans. Our efforts will focus on collecting de-identified datasets contributed by researchers.
Data will be publicly available for researchers across industries to use.

## Types of data needed: ##
De-identified clinical and demographical data of COVID patients from across all countries and healthcare sectors.

## Terms and conditions ##

The Medical Data Universe (MDU) is intending to establish a relationship between individuals and the MDU github repository for the purposes of managing the data sharing on the individual’s behalf. It provides complete control over the collected copy of the participant’s data to others. 
* By sharing data through this platform on git, any data pulled and pushed from the repository is accessible based github processes and you are agreeing to host your dataset here.
* This does not authorize the MDU github repository to function as a healthcare provider. 
* The participant’s copy of medical data does not replace existing provider-maintained records that law and regulation require healthcare providers to maintain, nor does it have any impact on provider responsibility to report public health data or perform any other functions related to medical records as may be required by law. 
* The individual and MDU, authorizes MDU, on participant’s behalf, to acquire, receive, collective, maintain, share, and delete the medical data as granted pursuant to this Agreement once the data shared through the MDU github repository.
* Participant must cite the original source of the shared data. 
* MDU shall not use or further disclose Participant’s data, either in whole or in part, other than as permitted by this Agreement.
